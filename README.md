# Hi, I'm Angus!

I'm a full stack software engineer currently based out of Los Angeles, California. I studied Cognitive Systems at the University of British Columbia where I learned about different topics in Computer Science, Philosophy, Linguistics, Psychology and their intersection in agentic learning.

- ⚙️ Some of the technologies I've worked with are Python, Typescript, Javascript, Java, Node.js, SQL, NoSQL, Redis
- ☀️ I enjoy staying active to offset all the hours at my desk. Catch me playing frisbee, gymming or boxing!
- 🤓 Right now, I'm learning about deep neural networks and understanding AI better.
